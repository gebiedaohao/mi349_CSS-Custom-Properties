                            The new lithium-iron phosphate blade battery has a significantly improved discharge
                            rate and a life span of 1.2 million km in 8 years. At the same time, the cost is
                            reduced by 30% and the energy density of the battery volume ratio is increased by
                            50%. The space utilization rate of the blade battery is about 60%, and that of the
                            traditional battery pack is about 40%.</p>
